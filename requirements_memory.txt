# Optional dependencies for enhanced memory functionality
# Install with: pip install -r requirements_memory.txt

# For advanced vector search and semantic similarity
faiss-cpu==1.7.4
# Alternative: faiss-gpu==1.7.4 (if you have GPU support)

# For high-quality text embeddings
sentence-transformers==2.2.2

# Core dependencies (numpy is already included with sentence-transformers)
numpy>=1.21.0

# Installation instructions:
# 1. Basic functionality works without these dependencies
